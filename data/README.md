# Data for testing and examples

This directory contains real data to be used in tests and examples within the Depthcharge documentation.
Currently, they all originate from [PXD000001](http://central.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD000001)

## Notes

-  [TMT10-Trial-8.mzML]( TMT10-Trial-8.mzML) was modified manually such that one "charge state" CV accession was changed to an "assumed charge state" CV accession.
